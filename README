MediaWiki extension that allows the creation of Guided Tours using a variant of Optimize.ly's Guiders.

To use:
* Put the extension files in your extension directory
* Add the following line to your LocalSettings.php
require_once( "$IP/extensions/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.php" );
* Copy the test tour in the file /extensions/GuidedTour/modules/tours/test.js to a page in the MediaWiki namespace on your server named MediaWiki:GuidedTour/test.js.  The full url would look something like http://MyServer/w/MediaWiki:GuidedTour/test.js
* Test that it worked by calling a page with tour=test appended to the URL. For example
http://MyServer/w/index.php?tour=test

* Write a real tour on a page in the MediaWiki namespage.  Perhaps called MediaWiki:GuidedTour/mytour.js
* Call your intended page with tour=mytour appended to the URL. For example
http://MyServer/w/index.php?tour=mytour
* The name of the tour stored on the wiki is the parameter you call it with.  In the examples above, that's 'test' and 'mytour'

* To style the output provide a file of overrides on the wiki page MediaWiki:GuidedTour/custom.css
