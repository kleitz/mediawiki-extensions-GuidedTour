https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GuidedTour

MediaWiki extension that allows the creation of Guided Tours using a variant of
Optimize.ly's Guiders.

It supports both extension-defined tours (with localization) and tours defined by editing
the MediaWiki namespace.

To use:
* Install the EventLogging extension, which is a dependency.
* Put the extension files in your extension directory
* Add the following line to your LocalSettings.php
require_once "$IP/extensions/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.php";
* Test that it worked by calling a page with tour=test appended to the URL. For
example http://MyServer/w/index.php?tour=test

'test' is a tour defined by the GuidedTour extenion.
* Write an on-wiki tour on a page in the MediaWiki namespace.  Perhaps called
MediaWiki:Guidedtour-tour-mytour.js

Use this naming convention regardless of name. 'mytour' is the name of this
local tour.
* Call your intended page with tour=mytour appended to the URL. For example
http://MyServer/w/index.php?tour=mytour
* The name of the tour is the parameter you call it with.
In the examples above, that's 'test' and 'mytour'

* To style the output provide a file of overrides on the wiki page
MediaWiki:Guidedtour-custom.css
